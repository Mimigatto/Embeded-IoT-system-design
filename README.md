 Overview 

  

This repository contains laboratory reports and associated code files from the Embedded & IoT Design course at the University of Verona. The report covers various assignments that explore different aspects of embedded systems, IoT, and AI-driven applications. 

  

 Key Assignments: 

  

- Assignment 1: Model-Based System Engineering & SysML   

  - Focuses on designing a switching system for two conveyors using MBSE and SysML modeling techniques. 

  - Assignment 2: Embedded AI Application Design   

  - Involves designing an AI application for embedded systems, considering hardware requirements, data preprocessing, and model optimization. 

  - Assignment 3: High-Level Synthesis on FPGA   

  - Details the implementation of an N-ALU for performing matrix computations using Verilog, optimized for FPGA. 

- Assignment 4: Verilog Modeling for Neural ALU   

  - Discusses the development and simulation of a neural arithmetic logic unit supporting matrix operations in IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point format. 

- Assignment 5: SystemC Programming   

  - Focuses on compilation, execution, and debugging with SystemC for embedded system design. 

- Assignment 6: Digital Twin Programming   

  - Demonstrates the integration and programming of a digital twin system. 

 Verilog and C Code Implementation 

 Verilog Code: 

The Verilog code implements matrix operations including multiplication, scalar multiplication, division, matrix transpose, determinant calculation, and trace computation for FPGA deployment. 

 C++ Code: 

A C++ implementation of the same matrix operations is also provided for testing and verification purposes. 

 Tools Used: 

- Vivado (for synthesis and analysis of the Verilog implementation) 

- SystemC (for compilation and simulation) 

- Cube.AI (for AI model analysis) 

 Usage 

1. Clone the repository:   

   git clone  https://github.com/Mimigatto/Embeded-IoT-system-design.git

2. Navigate to the desired folder and follow the instructions for each assignment to run the models and simulations.
